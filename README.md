Title: Euclidean Distance - Angle between vectors similarities
Execution of program (from cmd): python EuclideanDist.py
Description: The purpose of this program is to show how we can implement
             the concept of "vectorization" to perform classifications tasks.
Relevant classes: "Buildings_similarities" -> Class that implement the attributes
                   we consider relevant of a building. This class implements a 
                   vectorization method, so we can show explicitly how any object
                   can be understand via some of its internal attributes built upon             
                   a vector in the field of Real numbers.
Relevant functions: euclidean_dist -> Compute the Euclidean distance of two input building
                    vectors.
                    vect_norm -> Compute the norm of the input building vector.
                    normalized_build_vector -> Normalize all of the building vectors passed
                    in the input list.
                    compute_cos_angle -> Compute the angle between the two input building
                    vectors.
